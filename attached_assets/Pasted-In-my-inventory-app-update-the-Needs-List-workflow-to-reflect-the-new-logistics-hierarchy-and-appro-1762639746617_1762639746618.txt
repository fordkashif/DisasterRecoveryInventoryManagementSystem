In my inventory app, update the Needs List workflow to reflect the new logistics hierarchy and approval process as follows:
Roles & Workflow


Sub-Hubs and Agency Hubs can create and submit their own Needs Lists.


Logistics Officers can view all submitted Needs Lists and perform the initial fulfilment by:


Reviewing and verifying requests.


Assigning quantities to be fulfilled.


Selecting the source Hub(s) (Main or Sub-Hub) for each item.


Submitting the fulfilment for Logistics Manager approval.




Logistics Managers have final approval authority and can:


Approve or reject fulfilments prepared by Logistics Officers.


Make adjustments to allocations before final approval.


Approve and issue stock transfers to the requesting Hub once satisfied.




Once approved by the Logistics Manager, the fulfilment should automatically trigger:


Stock deduction from the supplying Hub(s).


Stock increment in the receiving Hub.


A log entry in the transaction records (marked as “Needs List Fulfilment”).




Additional Logic


Logistics Officers cannot finalize any fulfilment; their submissions require Logistics Manager approval before execution.


All Needs Lists should have a status field showing:


Draft (created by Sub-Hub/Agency)


Submitted (awaiting Logistics Officer review)


Fulfilment Prepared (by Logistics Officer)


Awaiting Approval (pending Logistics Manager)


Approved (by Logistics Manager)


Fulfilled (stock transfer completed)




Maintain audit logs showing:


Who created the Needs List


Who prepared the fulfilment


Who approved it and when




Ensure both Logistics Officers and Logistics Managers can filter and track Needs Lists by status and originating Hub.


Permissions Summary


Sub-Hubs & Agency Hubs: Create & submit Needs Lists only.


Logistics Officers: Review and perform initial fulfilment.


Logistics Managers: Final approval and execution of fulfilments.


Make sure this new workflow is reflected in both the UI and database logic, and update all related forms, lists, and reports accordingly.
