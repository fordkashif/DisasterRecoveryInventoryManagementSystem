In my DRIMS Flask app, create an in-app notification system for Agency Hub users so they receive notifications for every key update in their workflow.

Features & Behavior

Add a Notifications menu option (bell icon) to the Agency Hub’s left-side navigation bar.

When clicked, it opens a clean notification panel listing recent updates, sorted by most recent first.

Each notification should display:

Title: short summary (e.g., “Needs List Approved,” “Items Dispatched,” “Items Received Confirmation”).

Description: one-line detail (e.g., “Your Needs List NL-000004 has been approved by the Logistics Manager”).

Timestamp: date/time of event.

Optional icon or color tag by type (✔️ approvals, 📦 dispatch, 📥 receipt).

Trigger Events

Create backend events to push notifications for:

Needs List Submitted → Awaiting Review

Needs List Approved (Logistics Manager approval)

Items Dispatched (Logistics Officer or Manager dispatch)

Receipt Confirmed (when Agency confirms receipt)

(Optional) Message / Comment Added on their Needs List

Technical Implementation

Add a new Notification model with fields:

id, user_id, hub_id, title, message, type, status (unread/read), timestamp.

Each relevant route (approval, dispatch, receipt confirmation) should create a new notification entry for affected Agency Hub users.

On the frontend:

Show a small notification badge counter on the bell icon for unread messages.

Support marking notifications as read when opened or viewed.

Auto-refresh the list (or poll via AJAX/WebSocket) every few seconds for live updates.

UI / UX Guidelines

Use Bootstrap 5 dropdown or offcanvas panel for the notification list.

Keep layout minimal, readable, and mobile-friendly.

Include color accents or icons per notification type for quick scanning.

Provide a “View All Notifications” link to open a full history page.

Outcome

Agency Hub users get real-time, easy-to-read notifications for every workflow update.

The Logistics workflow remains unchanged, but Agency users are always informed of approvals, dispatches, and receipts directly inside the app.
