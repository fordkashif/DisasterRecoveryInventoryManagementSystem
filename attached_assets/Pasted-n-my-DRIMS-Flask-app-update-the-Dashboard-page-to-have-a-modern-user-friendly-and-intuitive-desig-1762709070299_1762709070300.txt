n my DRIMS Flask app, update the Dashboard page to have a modern, user-friendly, and intuitive design while maintaining performance and accessibility.

UI / UX Redesign Goals

Adopt a clean, data-driven layout that uses the available screen space efficiently.

Ensure the design aligns with the new left-side navigation layout for visual consistency.

Use Bootstrap 5, modern card-based panels, and responsive grids for a polished look on both desktop and tablet.

Dashboard Structure

Header Section:

Show key metrics at a glance using elegant cards with icons and soft color accents.

Include metrics such as:

Total Hubs (Main, Sub, Agencies)

Total Stock Units

Active Needs Lists

Pending Approvals (Transfers / Fulfilments)

Use subtle animations or counters to make key numbers more visually engaging.

Middle Section (Operational Insights):

Add a “Quick Overview” panel showing:

Hubs by status (Active vs Inactive) using small bar or donut charts.

Stock distribution by category (Food & Water, Hygiene & Sanitization, etc.).

Current fulfilment progress summary (Needs Lists in various statuses).

Use chart libraries like Chart.js or ApexCharts for lightweight, dynamic visuals.

Lower Section (Activity Feed):

Include a scrollable Recent Transactions & Activities list showing:

Stock intakes, distributions, and Needs List approvals.

Use color-coded badges or icons for quick recognition (e.g., 🟢 Intake, 🔵 Distribution, 🟡 Pending Approval).

Right Sidebar (Optional):

Show notifications, recent approvals, or quick actions (e.g., “Create Needs List,” “Add Hub,” “View Reports”).

Styling & Usability Enhancements

Use a light, flat modern palette with proper contrast and consistent font sizing.

Ensure good spacing and alignment — nothing should look cramped or oversized.

Include hover effects and tooltips for interactivity and better context.

Keep design minimal yet visually appealing — prioritize clarity and data visibility.

Make the layout fully responsive for different screen sizes.

Performance & Integration

Reuse existing data queries and endpoints — only enhance the layout and visuals.

Optimize for fast loading; lazy-load charts or heavy components if needed.

Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA): color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels.

The end result should be a modern, well-organized, and intuitive dashboard that gives users immediate visibility of operational status, fulfilment progress, and key logistics metrics.
